#notes for starting program
node_modules folder needs to be on the same level as package.json to properly install dependancies.
this should be on the top level of the file structure.
server.js must have the connect method for port 8000 and have node running on it.
then make sure that npm install is run in the folder with package.json so that dependancies are installed.
then run nodemon and define the path to www such that it knows where to find it. EX:
nodemon back-end/bin/www
this will render the route properly


angular requirements
must have routeProvider set up.
have default views and route to second view.
